# Push via GitHub Desktop

Since the repository exists but we're having authentication issues, let's use GitHub Desktop:

## Steps:

1. **GitHub Desktop should be open now**

2. **Add your repository:**
   - Click **"File"** → **"Add Local Repository"**
   - Click **"Choose..."** and select: `C:\Users\Titus\Documents\Magnolia App`
   - Click **"Add Repository"**

3. **You should see your commits** (including "Add admin dashboard, improved logo, and video management system")

4. **Click "Push origin"** button (or "Publish branch" if it's a new connection)

5. **If it asks for authentication**, GitHub Desktop will handle it automatically

## Alternative: Check Repository Name

Can you confirm the exact repository name? It might be:
- `magnolia-app` (lowercase)
- `Magnolia-App` (with capitals)
- `MagnoliaApp` (no hyphen)
- Something else?

Once I know the exact name, I can update the remote and push!
