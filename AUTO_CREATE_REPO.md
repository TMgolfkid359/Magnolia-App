# Creating Repository - Almost Automatic!

I've opened:
1. **GitHub Desktop** - You can publish from here
2. **GitHub New Repository Page** - Pre-filled with "magnolia-app"

## Quick Steps in GitHub Website (Already Open):

1. The page should be open with "magnolia-app" as the name
2. Choose **Private** or **Public**
3. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
4. Click **"Create repository"**
5. Come back and say "push now" and I'll push immediately!

## OR Use GitHub Desktop:

1. In GitHub Desktop, click **"File"** → **"Publish repository"**
2. Name: `magnolia-app`
3. Choose Private or Public
4. Click **"Publish Repository"**

---

Once the repository is created, I'll push all your changes immediately!
